						<p>"ARe You Ready is a game that was made for MediaMasters. The game was used during the week of media knowledge, an event where children learn how to navigate online media. In the game the player experiences the day of a twelve-year-old Dutch student in the year 2030. In this fictional future almost everyone has a pair AR glasses. While playing the game the player encounters various scenario involving AR. After each scenario the player is asked about their opinion by the ARchie. The video below shows the English version of the game. The English version of the game can be played below or on <a href="https://tinyurl.com/are-ready-en">CoSpaces</a> .

						<p>"During my fourth year of university, me and a group of seven other students created an AR application for the company Dialogic. We were asked to find a way to make data visible in AR. Over the course of half a year we created a system where you could use a link to a JSON file to generate pie and bar charts. They could be customized and be viewed in both the browsers and marker-based AR. Besides the different charts users could also upload images and text. All these elements could then be combined in a slideshow, which could be viewed in the browser and in marker-based AR. Below is the infographic we used to present the solution.</p>

						<p>"The Old Witch Tower is a 2D “horror” action-adventure game made in Unity. The game is based on the Wardstone Chronicles by Joseph Delaney and my first game made in Java. In this game you play as the young spook Chyntia. Together with her partner Gerg, she was tasked to investigate the old witch tower and clear it of any lingering ghosts. Before they can begin their investigation, Gerg foolishly rushes into the location. Now Chyntia must save her partner from whatever is inside that tower. The game can be played below or at  <a href="https://simmer.io/@Stripmaker24/the-old-witch-tower">simmer.oi</a>.</p>

						<p>During a group project I was tasked with making a digital calendar. With this calendar staff of the fictional company Bumbo can plan when they can not work. This calendar works like Google calendar. For this project I used JavaScript, JSON, .NET Core, and a small MSSQL database. The video below shows how the calendar works.</p>

						<p>At the end of my C# course, I made a website where you can make and manage Dungeon and Dragon characters and shops. To start a user needs to make an account to start creating characters. Each character gets their own bag of gold which they can spend at the different shops on the website. In each shop characters can by helms, chest pieces, pants, shoes, necklaces, and rings. All the shops on the website are maintained by the fictional staff of the website. The video below shows how all the different parts of the website work.</p>

						<p>At the end of my first year of university I made a Fruit Ninja clone in Java. The gameplay is based on Fruit Ninja, but the visuals are based on the game “The ElderScrolls V: Skyrim”. In this game the player needs to slice the apples and berries while avoiding the electric balls flying across the screen. The video below shows how the game is played.</p>

						<p>After half a year working with Java I created a text-based dungeon crawler. In this game the player moves from room to room by typing where they want to go. This game is inspired by Wardstone Chronicles by Joseph Delaney. The goal of the game is to save the family of the protagonist of the books. The video below shows how the game is played from start to end.</p>
